# Capture audience feedback with a serverless app

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/l2fprod/openwhisk-emoting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/l2fprod/openwhisk-emoting) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/l2fprod/openwhisk-emoting/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/l2fprod/openwhisk-emoting?branch=master)

You are giving this presentation and as attendees leave the room you'd like to get a quick feel about how you did. *Emoting* mimics the smiley terminals you may see at the airport security or whenever you are queueing somewhere.

Built using the IBM Bluemix, the application uses:
* IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk to host the backend
* Cloudant to persist the data
* GitHub Pages to host the frontend

No runtime to deploy, no server to manage :)

## Application Requirements

* IBM Bluemix account. [Sign up][bluemix_signup_url] for Bluemix, or use an existing account.

## Running the app on top of GitHub Pages and OpenWhisk

  1. Clone or fork the repository https://github.com/l2fprod/openwhisk-emoting

  1. Checkout the code

  1. Ensure your [OpenWhisk command line interface](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/cli) is property configured with:

  ```
  wsk list
  ```

  This shows the packages, actions, triggers and rules currently deployed in your OpenWhisk namespace.

  1. Create a Cloudant service in IBM Bluemix

  1. Copy the file named template-local.env into local.env

  ```
  cp template-local.env local.env
  ```

  1. Get the Cloudant service credentials from the Bluemix dashbaord and replace placeholders in `local.env` with corresponding values (url, username and password). These properties will be injected into a package so that all actions can get access to the database.

  1. Deploy the actions to OpenWhisk

  ```
  ./deploy.sh --install
  ```

  1. Expose the OpenWhisk actions as REST endpoints

  ```
  ./deploy.sh --installApi
  ```

  1. Make note of your API base path in the output. The base path looks like `https://123456-abcd-7890123-gws.api-gw.mybluemix.net/emoting/1`.

  1. Edit `docs/js/emoting.js` and change the `apiUrl` value to your API base path.

  1. Commit the `docs/js/emoting.js` file.

  1. Enable GitHub Pages on your repo. When doing so, select the option to use the `docs` folder in the master branch.

## Running the app locally

  1. Follow the previous steps to deploy the OpenWhisk actions.

  1. Make sure to edit `docs/js/emoting.js`

  1. Install dependencies

  ```
  npm install
  ```

  1. Start the local web server

  ```
  npm start
  ```

  1. Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080
